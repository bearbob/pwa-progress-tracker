# Progress Tracker PWA

A Progressive Web App (PWA) for tracking progress towards goals. This app allows users to create multiple trackers, each with a current value and target value. Progress is displayed visually with progress bars.

This project exists because I want to track some things on my smartphone but most native apps either have limitations to trigger subscriptions or are full of ads.

## Features

- Create multiple progress trackers with custom names
- Set current and target values for each tracker
- View progress as a percentage with visual progress bars
- Update values any time with automatic date tracking
- View history of all value updates
- Delete trackers when no longer needed
- Works offline with full PWA functionality
- All data stored locally on the device
- Installable on supported devices and browsers

## Technology

This app is built using standard web technologies:
- HTML5
